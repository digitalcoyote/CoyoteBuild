Early WIP. The plan is to have a series of NuGet packages that support various build actions as msbuild tasks to ease using other tools. First tool I'm looking at is dart-sass for compiling sass to css. If you have any requests, go ahead and create an issue and I may look into it after the first package gets off the ground.
